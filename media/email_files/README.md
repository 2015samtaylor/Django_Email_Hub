## README: Data Pipeline Automation

### Overview
This project demonstrates a data pipeline automation process using Python. It connects to a remote server via SFTP, downloads a file, uploads it to Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and then loads the data into BigQuery for analysis.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Usage
1. **Setup Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Credentials**:
   - Set up your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) credentials by creating a service account and downloading the JSON key file. Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path of your JSON key file.
   
2. **SFTP Configuration**:
   - Uncomment and configure the SFTP connection parameters in the provided script.

3. **Running the Script**:
   - Execute the script to start the data pipeline automation process. It will perform the following steps:
     - Connect to the SFTP server and download a remote file.
     - Create a new bucket in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) or use an existing one.
     - Upload the downloaded file to the GCS bucket.
     - Load the data from the GCS bucket into a BigQuery table.
     - Execute a SQL query on the BigQuery table for data analysis.

4. **Customization**:
   - Modify the `Create` class attributes to fit your specific data pipeline requirements.
   - Customize the SQL queries to analyze different datasets in BigQuery.

### Dependencies
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation library.
  - `pandas_gbq`: Google BigQuery integration for Pandas.
  - `pysftp`: SFTP client library.
  - `google-cloud-storage`: Google Cloud Storage client library.
  - `google-cloud-bigquery`: Google BigQuery client library.

### Notes
- Ensure that the SFTP server, Google Cloud Storage, and BigQuery environments are properly configured with the necessary permissions and access credentials.
- This script serves as a basic example and may require additional error handling, logging, and security enhancements for production use.
